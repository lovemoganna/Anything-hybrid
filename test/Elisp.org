* Elisp Concepts
  In eamcs,every user interactive is a function execution. There are two
types of functions in emacs:
- Normal Emacs: common funciton,just as implementing features in
  emacs.
- Commands: Commands are like funciton.but interactive.could directly
  use it.


** Emacs keys remember
   - ~C-x~ prefix is for default and global binding that come with
     eamcs.
   - ~C-c~ prefix is for users to define.
   - ~C-u~ for altering behaviors of commands.That is ,one command can
     behave differently depending on how many ~C-u~ you pressed first
     before executing a command.
   - ~C-<number>~ passing a number to a command.Usually,the number
     specifies how many times you want to repeated a command.

** Emacs manual
   
*** Man
    - ~man~ : get a Unix manual page and put it i a buffer.
    - ~woman~ : you can view man page without having the man program installed.
   


** TODO Opening Files
   use /Wildcard expression/ to select more than one file.If you
   dictnory contains these file:
   - file_a_1.c
   - file_a_2.c
   - file_a_3.c
   - file_a_1.h
   - file_a_2.c

   another command is =find-file-at-point=, What this function does is
   that if you ave a point to a directory or file under point.just
   run =M-x ffap=.

** IDO Mode
   ~IDO Mode~ ,short for ~Interactive do anything~.
   
   ~C-x C-d~ find-current-dir-file
   

** Major Mode
   Major Mode provide specialized facilities for working on a
   particular file type.

   Major Mode are mutually exclusive,each buffer has one and only one
   major mode at any time.

   
** Minor Mode 
   Minor Modes are optional features which you can turn on or off,not
   necessarily specific to a type or file or buffer.

   =Auto-fill-mode= is a minor mode in which SPC breaks lines between
   words as you type.

   Minor modes are independent of one another,and of the selected
   major mode.

** Buffer
   
   =M-x Ibuffer=

   enter =C-mode= and =emacs-lisp-mode=,You can create each group for
   one by pressing ~/g~ and give the group a name.
