*** Lord Of the Rings
    My favorites scenes are (in this order)
    1. The attack of the Rohirrim
    2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
       + this was already my favorite scenes in the book
       + I really like Miranda Otto.
    3. Peter Jackson Being shot by Legolas
       - on DVD only
    He makes a really funny face when it happens
    But in the end,on individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
    Important actors in this film are:
    - **Elijah** :: He Plays Frodo
    - **Sean Austin** :: He plays Sam
	 Him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in the goonies.

    You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =code= and
    ~verbatim~, and, if you must, +strike-through+.

*** Creating lists of all active TODOs
    repeated previous command 
    
*** Appointments and deadlines <2019-08-29 Thu 20:03>
    when a task is time related.then we usually put it in our
    calendar.This can also be done in Org Mode.

    And agenda can then show us a time-based list of our TODOs.This is
    done in the following way.

**** Control Time 
     two concepts: punching-in & punching-out,just for clock work.
     
     - Punch in (start the clock)
       + This clocks in a predefined task by ~org-id~ that is the
         default task to clock in whenever the clock normally stops.
     - Clocks in tasks normally,and let moving to a DONE state clock
       out.
       + clocking out automatically clocks time on a parent task or
         moves back to predefined default task if no parent exists.
     - Continue clocking whatever tasks you work on
     - Punch out (stop the clock)
     

     It's free to change the default task multiple time during the day
     but with the clock moving up the project tree on clock out i no
     longer need to do this.

     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     if have a ~projet x~ task:
         task automatically becomes the default task,all clocked time goes on that project
	 
        when punch out the task
	     leave that project,assign time give another task
	     
        or punch in another task
	     leave that project,assign time give another task
     #+END_SRC
