要想知道一个东西怎么用。就得自己动手用。

我需要一个聊天工具，而不是自己处于一个孤岛。

选一个和Emacs 集成度比较高的聊天工具 [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/erc.html][IRC]]。

** Intorduction

  ERC 是强大的，模块化的，Emacs 上的可扩展的客户端。自从22.1版本就和
  Emacs一起分发。

  下面的功能是自带默认开启的。
  - Flood control.
  - Timestamps
  - Join channels automatically
  - Buttonize URLs,nicenames,and other text.
  - Wrap long lines.
  - Highlight or remove IRC control characters
  - Highlight pals,fools, and other keywords.
  - Detect netsplits.
  - Complete nicknames and commands in a programmable fashion.
  - Make displayed lines read-only.
  - Input history.
  - Track channel activity in the mode-line.
  
** Getting Started
   
   - =M-x erc= start ERC and prompt for the server to conenct to.
   - if you want to place ERC settings in their own file,you can place
     them in =~/.emacs.d/.ercrc.el= , creating it if necessary.
   - if you would rather use the Customize interface to change how ERC
     works,do =M-x customize-group <RET> erc <RET>=.In particular,ERC
     comes with lots of modules that may be enabled or disabled; to
     select which ones you want, do =M-x customize-variable <RET>
     erc-modules <RET>= .
*** Sample Session
 
     very so sad! just run =erc-tls= is work for me. and the show
     windows very bad. my emacs version is ~28.0.50~.

   - if you would like to be able to talk with people privately on the
     freenode network,you will have to ~register~ your nickname. just
     need switch to the ~"irc.freennode.net:6667"~ buffer and type
     ~"/msg NickServ register <password> youremail@example.com"~.and
     input your email checkcode.if you not register , see [[https://www.jianshu.com/p/59c6aa6c7d7f][here]].

   - if you want to open a query buffer to talk to someone.type
     ~/query <nick>~.Note that if the other person is not
     registered,you will not be able to talk with them.

*** Special Feature
    
    - multiple channels and multiple servers
    - private message separation
    - highlighting
    - notification
    - channel tracking
    - nick completion
    - history
    - multiple language 

      different channels and servers may have different language encodings.
    - user scripting 

      Users can load scripts (e.g., *auto greeting* scripts) when ERC
      starts up.
      It is also possible to make custom IRC commands,if you know a
      little emacs lisp.Just make an Emacs lisp function and call it
      =erc-cmd-NEWCOMMAND=,where =NEWCOMMAND= is the name of the new
      command in capital letters.
    - auto reconnect 

      if the connection goes away at some point,ERC will try to
      reconnect automatically.If it fails to reconnect,and you want to
      try to manually reestablish the connection at some later
      point,switch to an ERC buffer and run the ~/RECONNECT~ command.
    
*** Keys Used in ERC
    - =C-c C-b= select one IRC buffer.
    - =C-c C-t= erc-set-topic.
      
      the following is #emacs channel topic:
      
      eamcs 27.0.90, the first pretest for 27.1, is out.  Please test. "Ask
      not what your Emacs can do for you, but what you can do for your
      Emacs" -- JFK | EmacsConf 2019 videos now out!
      https://emacsconf.org/2019/videos | Emacs questions take
      priority over off-topic chatter, so ask! | No public logging!
      What happens in #emacs stays in #emacs |.

    - =C-c C-p= leave the channel reaseon.
    - =C-c C-q= quite the ERC service.
    - =C-c C-o= see current channel mode.
    - =C-c C-e= interactively input a user action and send it to IRC.
    - =C-c C-n= erc-channel-names --- run ~/names #channel~ in the
      current channel.
    - =C-c C-f= erc-toggle-flood-control
    - =C-c C-l= erc-save-buffer-in-logs --- Interactively open an
      erc-log-matches buffer. if not work,should run =M-x
      erc-log-enable=.
    - =C-c C-o= erc-get-channel-mode-form-keypress --- if ~l~ press,
      =erc-set-channel-limit= gets called. if ~k~ is pressed,
      =erc-set-channel-key= gets called.Anythings else will be sent
      to =erc-toggle-channel-mode=.


    
    
*** Modules
    One way to add functionality to ERC is to customize which of its
    many modules are loaded.
    
    - run =M-x customize-options <RET> erc-modules <RET>=.
    - set done,run =erc-update-modules= update ERC setting.
      

*** Advanced Usage

**** Connecting
     if you want to assign this function to a keystroke,the following
     will help you figure out itss parameters.

      我只知道，如果再不行动，未来只会进一步的被宰割。这样，在面对灾
      难的时候，只能等死。
      
      如果遭遇了不幸，至少还可以触发宏，干他娘的。
