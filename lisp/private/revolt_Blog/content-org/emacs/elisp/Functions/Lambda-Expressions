#+title: LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS

A lambda expression is a function object written in lisp.

<!--more-->

example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports result
  (lambda(x)
    "return the hyperbolic consine of X (双曲线余弦值)"
    (* 0.5 (+ (exp x) (exp (- x))))
    )
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| lambda | (x) | return the hyperbolic consine of X (双曲线余弦值) | (* 0.5 (+ (exp x) (exp (- x)))) |


In Emacs lisp,such a list is a valid expression which evaluates to a
function object.

A lambda expression,by itself,has no name;it is an anonymous
function.Althogh lamda expressions can be used this way (see [[*Anonymous function][Anonymous
function]]),they more commonly associated with symbols to make named
functions (See [[*Function Names][Function Names]]).Before going into these detail,the
following subsections describe the componenets of a lambda expression
and what they do.

- [[*Lambda Components][Lambda Components]]: The parts of a lambda expression.
- [[*Simple Lambda][Simple Lambda]]: A simple example.
- [[*Agrument list][Agrument list]]: Details and special features of arguments list.
- [[*Function Documentation][Function Documentation]]: How to put documentation in a function.


** Lambda Components
   A lambda expression is a list that looks like this:
   
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (lambda (arg-variables...)
       [documentation-string]
       [interactive-declaration]
       body-forms...
       )
   #+end_src

   The first element of a lambda expresion is always the symbol lambda.
   This indicates that the list represents a function.The reason
   function are defined to start with lambda is so that other lists,
   intended for other uses,will not accidentally be valid as
   functions.
   
   The second element is a list of symbols-*the argument variable
   names*.This is called the lambda list.When a lisp function is
   called,the argument values are matched up against the variables in
   the lambda list,which are given local bindings with the values
   provided.See [[*Local Variables][Local Variables]].

  
   The documentation string is a lisp string object placed within the
   function definition to describe the function for the Emacs help
   facilities.See [[*Function Documentation][Function Documentation]].
   
   The interactive declaration is a list of the form(interactive
   /code-string/).This declares how to provide agruments if the
   function is used interactively.Functions with this declaration are
   called commands;they can be called using =M-x= or bound to a
   key.Functions not intended to be called in this way should not have
   interactive declaration.See [[*Defining Commands][Defining Commands]],for how to write an
   interactive declaration.

   The rest of the elements are the body of the function: the lisp
   code to do the work of the function (or, as a lisp programmer would
   say, "a list of lisp forms to evaluate"). The value returned by the
   function is the value returned by the last element of the body.

** Simple Lambda 
   #+name: code_lambda_demo1
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports result
     (lambda (a b c) (+ a b c))
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS: code_lambda_demo1
   | lambda | (a b c) | (+ a b c) |
   
   How to we call this lambda function?
   
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports result
     (funcall
      (lambda (a b c)(+ a b c))
      1 2 3)
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 6
   
   Note that the arguments can be the reuslts of other function
   calls,as in this example:
   
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes :exports result
     (funcall (lambda (a b c) (+ a b c)) 1 (* 2 3) (+ 3 4 6))
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 20

   As these examples show,you can use a form with a lambda expression
   as its CAR to make local variables and give them values.
   
   In the old days of lisp,this technique was the only way to bind and
   initialize local variables.
   
   But nowadays,it is clearer to use the special form =let= for this
   purpose.(see [[*Local Variables][Local Variables]]).Lambda Expression are mainly used as
   anonymous function for passing as arguments to other function.(see
   [[*Anonymous function][Anonymous function]]),or stored as symbol function definitions to
   produce named functions(see [[*Function Names][Function Names]]).

** Local Variables
   Global variables have values that last until /explicitly
   superseded/ （显式的取代）with new vlaues.
   
   When a variable has a local value,we say that it is "locally bound"
   to that value,and that it is a "local variable".

   For example,when a function is called,its agrument variables
   receive local values,which are the actual arguments supplied to the
   function call; these local bindings take effect within the body of
   the function.
   
   To take another example, the ~let~ special form explicitly
   establishes local bindings for specific variabels,which take effect
   only within the body of the ~let~ form.
   
   We also speak of the ="global binding"=,which is where
   (conceptually 概念上) the global value is kept.
   
   Establishing a local binding saves away the variable 's previous
   value(or lack of one).We say that the previous value is
   shdowed.Both global and local values my be shadowed.It determines
   the value returned by
