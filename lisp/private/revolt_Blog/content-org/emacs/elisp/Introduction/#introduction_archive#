  In Elisp, the symbol ~nil~ has three separate meanings:
   
  - it is a symbol with the name ='nil'=
  - it is the logical truth value =false=
  - it it the *empty list*-the list of zero elements.when used as a
    variable,nil always has the value nil.
     
  As far as the following testing, ='()'= and =nil= are identical:
   
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports all :results output
    (print (message "the value of () is %S" ())) ;;nil
    (print (message "the value of nil is %S" nil)) ;; ;;nil
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 
  : "the value of () is nil"
  : 
  : "the value of nil is nil"
